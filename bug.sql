The following SQL query contains a subtle error related to the use of `COUNT(*)` with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses, which can lead to unexpected results when dealing with NULL values in a particular column:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS num_products
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This query aims to retrieve categories that have more than one product. However, if the `category` column allows `NULL` values, rows with `NULL` in the `category` column will be grouped together. Thus, the `COUNT(*)` will include these `NULL` entries, potentially skewing the results. If there are multiple products with `NULL` as their category, the query might return a category `NULL` with a count greater than 1 even though no actual non-NULL category has more than one product.

This error arises from an implicit grouping of `NULL` values, which is not always obvious or intended.
